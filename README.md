# DeepLabV3

In this repository we reproduce the DeepLabv3 paper which can be found here: [Rethinking Atrous Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05587.pdf)
The DeepLabv3 model expects the feature extracting architecture to be ResNet50 or ResNet101 so this repository will also contain the code of the ResNet50 and ResNet101 architecture.
We will also release colab notebook and pretrained models.
